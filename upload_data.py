"""
When to use References
wandb.Artifact.add_reference("link to s3 bucket")
According to the documentation, this is best used when your files are stored in external object storage like an Amazon S3 bucket. This is useful when:

Data is huge: You have a 1TB dataset that is too large to upload to W&B.

Data is restricted: The data cannot leave your corporate cloud bucket for security reasons.

Duplicate Avoidance: You don't want to create copies of data that is already safely stored in the cloud.
